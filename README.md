Preventive Treatment with a CD73 Small Molecule Inhibitor Increases M1 Macrophage, CD4 and CD8 T cell Infiltration and Inhibits K-Ras Mutant Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia Progression
# Summary:
Cancer immunoprevention is an emerging consideration for solid tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We and others have shown that Kras mutations in genetic models of spontaneous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), which is a precursor to PDAC results in CD73 expression in the neoplastic epithelium and some populations of infiltrating immune cells, including macrophages and CD8+ T cells. CD73 is the gatekeeper ecto-enzyme responsible for converting extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine, a critical immune inhibitory molecule in PDAC. We hypothesized inhibition of CD73 would reduce the incidence of PanIN formation and alter adenosine-dependent changes in the stromal and immune microenvironments. To test our hypothesis, we used the KrasG12D; PdxCre1 (KC) genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model and tested the utility of AB-680, a small molecule inhibitor targeting CD73, to inhibit PanIN progression. AB-680, or vehicle control, was given three days/week at 10mg/kg, beginning when the mice were two months old and lasting three months. We euthanized the mice at five months old. In the KC model, we quantified significantly less pancreatitis, early and late PanIN, and quantified a significant increase in M1 macrophages in AB-680-treated mice. Single Cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of pancreata of AB-680 treated mice revealed increased infiltration of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and mature B cells. The scRNA-seq analysis also revealed CD73 inhibition reduced basophil, B cell progenitor, and PanIN cell populations. CD73 inhibition expanded unique clonotypes of TCR and BCR indicating inhibition of CD73 augments adaptive immunity early in the neoplastic microenvironment.
